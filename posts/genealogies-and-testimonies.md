title: A Testimony of Genealogy

Growing up in Evangelical churches one of the most common things you're coached on is how to give your testimony, especially in your high school years. 1 Peter 3:15 was an oft quoted passage, "[...] always being ready to make a defense to everyone who asks you to give an account for the hope that is in you." I recall times around a campfire when three young ladies would get up and share about how a certain event caused them serious depression that culminated in suicide ideation, but God ultimately brought them through it. I would hear stories of power lifters, now sold out evangelists, who were delivered from decades of drug abuse. Some of my favorites were stories of Muslims who encountered visions of Jesus and turned their allegiance to him and his Kingdom immediately.

Being a kid steeped in Scripture, formed in a Christian household from a young age, with a very small record of Sunday services skipped, I felt jipped. I had no story of God's deliverance in my life up to that point. I didn't have a story with a beginning, middle, and end. In fact, if someone were to ask me for my testimony, I don't know that I could have given it to him.

Fortunately, in my later teen years I was afforded the chance to experience depression, self-harm, suicide ideation, pornography addiction, and complete disillusionment with God and his Church. I am of course making light of what were serious issues in my life and issues many people experience, and I testify to the fact that God is a great deliverer. The reality is that many of us as kids who grew up in Evangelical Protestant churches feel a serious pressure to get stories like this, or to over-manufacture the severity of them, because what is a Christian conversion if there isn't radical transformation or major deliverance?

I think approaching a Christian life and story in this way robs God of his power. We say without words that the only way God can save is if you were an absolute mess, as if to say that if you weren't a mess perhaps you wouldn't need Christ. This is what Dallas Willard calls a Gospel of Sin Management in his book [The Divine Conspiracy](https://www.amazon.com/Divine-Conspiracy-Rediscovering-Hidden-Life/dp/0060693339). While sin and the freedom from it is core to the work and life of Jesus, his message was largely about a soon coming Kingdom of which if we would repent and believe, we could be a part of.
 
 I will argue that while there is a firm place and tradition in the Church for the roller-coaster testimony of total conversion, there is an equal, if not higher, place for generational covenant faithfulness, or as I will call it, a testimony of genealogy.

The most commonly skipped over passages in Scripture tend to be genealogies. I get it, they're long and often don't

## My Testimony of Genealogy

I don't know much about my great-grandfathers, and I know less about their walk with Jesus. Both great-grandfathers on my dad's side passed by the time I was in first grade. I know this, my paternal grandma's dad was a World War II veteran who later in his life became a minister at a church in eastern Pennsylvania. He set the spiritual tone and direction for his family. My paternal grandpa's dad was also a World War II veteran who served in the Pacific Theater. Sometime during his time in the army, he was stationed at Santa Ana Army Air Base. On the base he was baptized into the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. I don't know much about his spiritual walk beyond this recent discovery. While there may have been some spiritual formation among my mom's grandparents, what I know, or even she knows, is murky in some areas.

As for my grandparents, my dad's parents spent significant time in the church and still remain active members in their local community today. I grew up attending church with my grandparents. At four my grandmom was my Sunday school teacher and my grandpa taught adult Sunday school classes. While I know little about what their spiritual leadership was like as my dad was being raised, they set a standard for Christian life and community that I still aspire to experience.

My dad became sold out for Jesus during his high school years after reading a Bill Bright book. He immediately wanted to become an evangelist and eventually joined a traveling ministry called Christ is the Answer. Early in my life he served as the pastor of a small Holiness-inspired congregation in Maryland. My mom effectively grew up in the church and was deeply influenced by her children's pastor. She attended Christian school up through 8th grade, and so was deeply formed in the Church from a young age.

I was born into the Church of the Nazarene. I was dedicated by Pastor David Watts at Reading Calvary Church of the Nazarene. Both of my parents served in the church in various capacities and were committed to forming us well as kids at home. I wouldn't ever say we had a restrictive home in terms of media, but my parents were very conscious about the media we were exposed to. I grew up on VeggieTales, Adventures in Odyssey, and Storykeepers. My parents would hold regular family meetings where my dad would give some sort of Bible teaching or share a spiritual disciple he was working on. My mom homeschooled us and she and I often had deep theological discussions throughout my time growing up.

Beyond my family I could go on to list the myriad of pastors, spiritual leaders, and authors who have shaped and influenced me over the past 25 years, but the list would likely double the reading time of this article.
