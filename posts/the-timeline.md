Death surveyed the battlefield, and felt sorrow.

The ceaseless violence brought about at the hands of humans was unbearable to him. Long had he left the mortal ways of humans, and now was he tasked with ushering them on to the train that bore them Beyond. With each passing day he felt the weight crushing his soul. Each child or mother that fell at the hands of another's sword destroyed him. But he had no power over their actions, all he could do was comfort them on their journey to their graves.

It was Death's custom to walk the fields of battle, after their subsiding, and survey the carnage. He took no pleasure in it. But there was something about walking from one end of the field to the other that gave him a sense of comfort. Perhaps it was because if he would walk far enough, he would see a horizon. A gentle sunset or a cool stream, and he would know that all wars came to an end. All battlefields had a limit. And after this ritual he would begin.

You must understand something important about Death. Firstly, there have been many Death's over the years. Some have gone crazy, others have been deposed, and others have retired. Often a new Death is picked from the souls of the recently departed, and they are instated for the task of ferrying people across the Wood Between Worlds on to the train to the Beyond. The other thing you must understand is that the Wood, and so too Death, does not operate linearly in the way that you, dear reader, likely think of time. This Death had served as ferryman for the Peloponnesian War, the Civil War, and both Secret Wars (though you won't have heard of those yet).
