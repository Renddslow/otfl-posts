title: Imagining a Different World
---

Right now I'm processing through Walter Brueggemann's masterwork, __The Prophetic Imagination__. It's a book I've been anxious to read for awhile now, but as I work through it, I feel like I'm getting punched in the gut with every-other line. One of the prevailing themes of the book is that the people of God need to reclaim their prophetic voice. Their voice is not found in the current politic, nor by aligning themselves with the powers of Babylon. Rather their voice is found in recognizing the freedom of their God. He is not bound by any tradition or power or person. 

The thing that recently hit me while reading was this idea that we in the progressive West are really quick to jump to solutions and implementations. We see a problem and nobly set forth a plan to correct it. And this isn't necessarily wrong, it's good to be able to identify and call out evil, harm, and injustice. But Brueggemann argues that without a prophetic imagination of the different world, it is impossible to really solve any systemic problems.

Brueggemann puts forward Moses, who with the help of God created a freed people group out of an oppressive evil empire. There were no categories for a nation of priests ([Exodus 19:6](https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-6.htm)) that worked the ground as farmers. Their king, if they had one, was to first and foremost be a student of Scripture ([Deuteronomy 17:14-20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+17%3A14-20&version=NASB)) and was not attempt to become like one of the kings of the empires surround Israel. A nation with no king. Such a structure would have been blasphemous in the courts of King Pharoah. The divine powers were held in place by the Pharoah. Order and immortality were granted through his reign. 

It's clear that imagining such an upside-down social structure was impossible for Israel (see [1 Samuel 8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Samuel+8&version=NASB)). By the time of Solomon, a mere two generations after Israel's first king, the hope of a nation that would be anything close to an antithesis to Egypt had evaporated ([1 Kings 9:15](https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-15.htm), [1 Kings 10:28](https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-28.htm), [1 Kings 11:2](https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-2.htm)). Despite the fact that the solution for a good nation was presented to God's people, they weren't able to capture that imagination for themselves.

All this talk of imagination led me to thinking about a climate change. I share a view with many Biblical scholars and theologians, among them Sandra Richter, N. T. Wright, C. S. Lewis, and Tim Mackie, that God created this good earth and set humans over it as just kings and queens. But when humans rebelled against God and began defining right and wrong according to their own wisdom, the earth was not stripped of its goodness. Rather the good relationship between humans and the ground was compromised and cursed ([Gen 3:17](https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-17.htm)). Where once a river ([Gen 2:10](https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-10.htm)) watered the garden and produced fruit-bearing trees, man will now have to work the fields and fight against thistle and thorn. Where once work was his blessing, now work is his curse. So while we toil with the earth, it is still God's good world, and we still bear responsibility over its care and protection.

Now it can be easy to get distracted by high-minded ideals about our place in the cosmos. And there are plenty of folks who would argue with that take on Scripture. So while I think that appealing to our God-given responsibility as kings and queens over creation is the way to go, I will appeal to another concept that also shows up on the first three pages of Genesis.

Humankind first appears on page one of the Bible ([Genesis 1:26-31](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+1%3A26-31&version=NASB)).

> Then God said, "Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky, over the livestock and all the wild animals, and over all the creatures that move along the ground." 
> So God created mankind in his own image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them. God blessed them and said to them, "Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky and over every living creature that moves on the ground." 
> Then God said, "I give you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food. And to all the beasts of the earth and all the birds in the sky and all the creatures that move along the ground--everything that has the breath of life in it--I give every green plant for food." 
> And it was so. God saw all that he had made, and it was very good. And there was evening, and there was morning--the sixth day.

My favorite part of this narrative is the use of the word image. In Hebrew the word is [__tselem__](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/6754.htm). The word is often used throughout Hebrew Scripture to refer to fashioned objects created for worship ([2 Kings 11:18](https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-18.htm)). God fashioned for himself images to reflect his own goodness and beauty. And he called those images which he fashioned __adam__ or human. Therefore there is a tacit respect and dignity granted to all human persons for they are the living images of the creator God.

With that in view, there is something profoundly cosmological to the simple statement of the Torah teaching: "...but you shall love your neighbor as yourself: I am the Lord" ([Leviticus 19:18](https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-18.htm)). Jesus then picks up on this theme when asked what the greatest commandment is ([Matt 22:36-40](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+22%3A36-40&version=NASB)), love the Lord your God ([Deut 6:4-5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+6:4-5&version=NASB)) and love your neighbor as yourself. Jesus argues that all the teachings of Moses and indeed, his own teachings on life in the Kingdom can largely be summed up in those commands.

So if love of neighbor is integral to Christian life and practice, how ought we to view the issues surrounding climate change. According to [a recent article by Mercy Corp](https://www.mercycorps.org/articles/climate-change-affects-poverty), climate change will have the most dramatic affect on already impoverished countries in the Global South. The increase in extreme weather events coupled with growing droughts will have a negative affect on folks basic needs, like food, shelter, and clean drinking water. Meanwhile over the next decade, while these conditions will intensify closer to the equator,
