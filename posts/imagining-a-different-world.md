title: Imagining a Different World
---

Right now I'm processing through Walter Brueggemann's masterwork, __The Prophetic Imagination__. It's a book I've been anxious to read for awhile now, but as I work through it, I feel like I'm getting punched in the gut with every-other line. One of the prevailing themes of the book is that the people of God need to reclaim their prophetic voice. Their voice is not found in the current politic, nor by aligning themselves with the powers of Babylon. Rather their voice is found in recognizing the freedom of their God. He is not bound by any tradition or power or person. 

The thing that recently hit me while reading was this idea that we in the progressive West are really quick to jump to solutions and implementations. We see a problem and nobly set forth a plan to correct it. And this isn't necessarily wrong, it's good to be able to identify and call out evil, harm, and injustice. But Brueggemann argues that without a prophetic imagination of the different world, it is impossible to really solve any systemic problems.

Brueggemann puts forward Moses, who with the help of God created a freed people group out of an oppressive evil empire. They were no categories for a nation of priests ([Exodus 19:6](https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-6.htm)) that worked the ground as farmers. Their king, if they had one, was to first and foremost be a student of Scripture ([Deuteronomy 17:14-20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+17%3A14-20&version=NASB)) and was not attempt to become like one of the kings of the empires surround Israel. But this is a hard thing to imagine, even as a Westerner living with liberties that were unprecedented in either the Ancient Near East or the first-century Mediterranean. 

According to the Exodus account ([Exodus 12:40-41](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+12:40-41&version=NASB)), the Israelite people lived in Egypt 430 years. To put that in perspective, I live in the United States. The United States established their independence as a nation in 1776, which at the time of this writing was only 243 years ago. In that time we've had a foreign invasion, a Civil War, two world wars, several "wars against communism," a few wars in the middle east, and a handful of other wars mixed in. In addition to wars, we've gone from a nation built on chattel slavery, to a nation built on grossly under-paid workers within our own borders, to a nation built on under-paid works and technology both within our own borders but largely abroad. We've gone through many political and cultural ebbs and flows all progressing to an idyllic "city on a hill" (read: definitely super not communist). But with all the change and conflict and injustice, we've only existed for 243 years. Now imagine living in a culture that was perhaps the ancient equivalent to the United States for nearly twice that time. Your culture values and imaginations are shaped by the state and it's God-in-a-box religious ideal.
