I am Matt McElwee. I am not a scholar, a member of the clergy, nor a grad student, though I one day hope to be all of these things. Right now I am simply a software engineering manager who likes to read a lot. This blog is not meant to serve expert opinions nor offer theological hot-takes. It is designed merely to be an outlet for me to synthesize the things I am learning through the works of theological/scholarly giants (see my [bibliography](/bibliography) for what I've been reading over the past few years, I recommend, though may not 100% agree with, every book on that list).

My goal is to find for myself and the community I surround myself with a pathway of spiritual formation rooted in the ancient/future rhythms of the Church that balances scholarship, pastoral care, worship, and personal practice.

You're welcome to join me on the journey, but look to someone more qualified for leadership and guidance.
